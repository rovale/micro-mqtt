# micro-mqtt

A lightweight MQTT client. I keep it to stay up to date with TypeScript. Don't use it for anything serious! :-)

## Technial notes
- The [npm-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) are documented with [npm-scripts-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-scripts-info).

- The unit tests can be debugged in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The .vscode/launch.json is configured for this project, just put a breakpoint in the TypeScript code and press F5.

- Based on the [Espruino MQTT.js module](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoDocs/blob/master/modules/MQTT.md) by Lars Toft Jacobsen (boxed.dk), Gordon Williams. License: MIT.
